# Dog-Bread-Analyser-Using-Transfer-Learning
The "Dog-Breed-Identification-Using-Transfer-Learning" builds an AI to classify dog breeds. It uses transfer learning, adapting a pre-trained deep learning model to recognize features and fine-tune for breed identification. The aim is an AI that identifies dog breeds from images by leveraging powerful existing models.
